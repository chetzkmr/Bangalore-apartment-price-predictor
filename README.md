# Bangalore-apartment-price-predictor

Objective:
The goal of this data analysis project is to develop a predictive model for apartment prices in Bangalore. This involves exploring and analyzing various features that influence housing prices in the city, like rooms, square-feet, locality etc; creating a robust dataset, and building a predictive model that can estimate apartment prices based on input features.

Key Steps:

    Data Collection:
        Gathered data from diverse sources and other relevant datasets.
        Collected information on various features such as location, size, amenities, proximity to essential services, and historical pricing trends.

    Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
        Handled missing values, outliers, wrong informations or false values and inconsistencies in the dataset.
        Conducted data preprocessing steps, converting all values into numerical values, including normalization using MinMax scaler.

    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
        Explored the dataset using descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to understand the relationships between different features and housing              prices. Identified key factors influencing property prices in Bangalore.

    Feature Engineering:
        Created new features or transformed existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
        Engineered features such as location indices, size, total price and neighborhood characteristics.

    Model Building:
        Selected appropriate regression model, i.e LinearRegression for predicting apartment prices.
        Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
        Explored machine learning algorithms such as linear regression.

    Model Evaluation and Optimization:
        Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, and R-squared.

    Interpretation and Insights:
        Interpreted model coefficients and feature importance to understand the impact of different factors on apartment prices.
        Extracted actionable insights for homebuyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.

Conclusion:
The Bangalore Apartment Price Predictor project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to provide a valuable tool for stakeholders in the real estate market. The predictive model offers insights into the factors influencing apartment prices, empowering users to make informed decisions in the dynamic and diverse real estate landscape of Bangalore.
